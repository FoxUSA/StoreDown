StoreDown is a Progressive Web App(PWA) designed to help you put stuff away and find it again.
Due to the way StoreDown was built it can also be a forms application fronting CouchDB.(Like a very simple alternative of Microsoft Access)

I personally use StoreDown every day to keep track of 1,359 items <sup> at time of writing</sup>. Those items range from: a 90 pack of dental floss picks, a Jig saw, a refrigerator, to red 15W USB A to USB C cable(of which I have 6). If having this capability appeals to you, come along and enjoy the fun!

## FAQ

> Why not just use a spreadsheet?

The first answer is mobile. Spreadsheets work terrible on mobile.
The second answer is customization. The ability to search via UPC codes is the killer application for this system.

> So you read "Don't store up" and built an inventory system?

Keeping track of what you have and storing up are separate things.
Keeping track of things lets you do cool things like see the last time something was used.
Haven't use the rock band drums in 3 years? Might do good for someone else.
This use case alone is why this system is called `StoreDown`.

Also allows you to not over consume.
Another killer application of this system is just label cables.
- Do I have an unused HDMI cable somewhere?
- I need a USB-A to micro-USB cable thats at least 7 feet long.

Labeling items allows some unforeseen benefits like:
- Sending someone not technical to retrieve a parallel port.
- Answering questions like:
  - When did I buy xyz?
  - It's broken. Is it under warranty?

> I don't like xyz about StoreDown, do you know of any alternatives? 

I would really like to be friends with the folks in orbit around [InvenTree](https://github.com/inventree/InvenTree) and [Grocy](https://github.com/grocy/grocy). 
So go check those out.
